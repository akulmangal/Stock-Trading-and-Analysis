# Stock-Trading-and-Analysis
After surveying 18 successful NSE stock traders, a similar concern/problem was found amongst them. 
Stock traders encounter issue finding an easy-to-use trading platform that caters to all their needs such as 
being able to buy or sell a stock, viewing all their transactions, viewing their portfolio, being able to place 
recurring orders, getting help with the decision making of buying/selling stocks, being able to predict the 
stock prices for their future reference etc. They have to place stock orders physically/through call, browse 
through multiple websites for information, manually work out several exhausting calculations to come up 
with all these wants. Traders want to be able to view all their stocks in a consolidated manner in one place 
instead of keeping track for each company’s stock separately. Moreover, new traders are very reluctant to 
enter the stock market since they have no one to help them choose the right time to buy/sell a particular stock.
This seems very impractical and something avoidable.
The founders and creators of Stock Pro have noted down all these requirements and worked towards fulfilling 
each one of them in a single website so that traders can conveniently trade and analyze all NSE stocks/their 
holdings.

This project has been made in very user friendly and convenient way such that any user, even Naïve users can 
use and enjoy the benefits of the platform.

about financial markets, stock pro will guide him throughout regarding which stock should be purchased and 
how to transact. This software will help the user by giving the predictions of stock in the near future which shall 
help him/her decide whether to buy that stock or not.
